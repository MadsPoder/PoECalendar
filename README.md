# PoE Race Calendar
Simple C# program to parse the JSON data returned from api.pathofexile.com. <br />
Specifically designed to generate an ics file with all current events.

It uses the [JSON.net](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json) library.
<br />
You can download the calendar for the newest race season (in between season races) [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MadsPoder/PoECalendar/master/src/InBetweenSeasonRaces.ics). <br />
I recommend making a secondary calendar because of the rather large amount of events.

<br />
<br />
If you for some reason want the calendar for old events, they're available for download below.<br />
