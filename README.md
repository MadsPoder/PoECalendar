# PoE Race Calendar
Simple C# program to parse the JSON data returned from api.pathofexile.com. <br />
Specifically designed to generate an ics file with all current events.

It uses the [JSON.net](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json) library.


You can download the calendar for the medallion race season ~~here~~ (Will be added when GGG Adds the URL for the individual races). <br />
I recommend making a secondary calendar because of the rather large amount of events.
<br />
If you for some reason want the calendar for last winterheart season, it is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MadsPoder/PoECalendar/master/src/PoEWinterheartRaceSeason.ics).
