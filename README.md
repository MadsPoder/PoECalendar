# PoECalendar
Simple C# program to parse the json data returned from api.pathofexile.com. <br />
Specifically designed to generate an iCal file with all current events.

It uses the [JSON.net](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json) library.


You can download the calender [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MadsPoder/PoECalender/master/PoERaces.ics). I recommend making a secondary calendar because of the rather large amount of events.
